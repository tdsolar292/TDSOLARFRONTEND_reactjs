# FinancialReports Component - Unit Test Documentation

## 📋 Overview

This comprehensive test suite validates all functionality of the **FinancialReports** component, including the critical fix for Total Credit/Debit/Net calculations that were previously showing as 0.

## 🎯 Test Coverage

The test suite covers **10 major areas** of functionality:

### 1. **Component Rendering** (3 tests)
- ✅ Component renders without crashing
- ✅ All section tabs are displayed
- ✅ Loading spinner shows while fetching data

### 2. **Total Calculations** (3 tests) ⭐ **CRITICAL**
- ✅ Calculates totals correctly without filters
- ✅ Recalculates totals when filters are applied
- ✅ **Handles main account filter array correctly** (the bug fix)

**Bug Fixed**: The component was comparing `mainAccountFilter` (an array) directly to strings, causing totals to always be 0. The fix uses `mainAccountFilter.includes()` and checks `length > 0`.

### 3. **Data Filtering** (5 tests)
- ✅ Filter by date range (startDate, endDate)
- ✅ Filter by from account
- ✅ Filter by to account  
- ✅ Filter by verified status (YES/NO)
- ✅ Clear all filters functionality

### 4. **Sorting Functionality** (3 tests)
- ✅ Default sort by date descending
- ✅ Toggle sort direction on column click
- ✅ Numeric sorting for amount field

### 5. **Pagination** (3 tests)
- ✅ Paginate data correctly with default page size
- ✅ Navigate between pages
- ✅ Change page size (20, 50, 100)

### 6. **CRUD Operations** (4 tests)
- ✅ Open add modal
- ✅ Open edit modal with existing data
- ✅ Show delete confirmation dialog
- ✅ Execute delete API call

### 7. **Verification System** (3 tests)
- ✅ Display verification counts (total, verified, unverified)
- ✅ Verify selected items
- ✅ Select/deselect all items

### 8. **Navigation & Section Switching** (2 tests)
- ✅ Switch between tabs (Credit/Debit, Loans, Summary, etc.)
- ✅ Navigate from Summary with applied filters

### 9. **View Details Modal** (2 tests)
- ✅ Open view details modal
- ✅ Close view details modal

### 10. **Export Functionality** (1 test)
- ✅ Export filtered data to Excel

## 🐛 Critical Bug Test - Total Calculations

### The Problem
The Total Credit, Debit, and Net values were always displaying as **0** even when data existed.

### Root Cause
```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE (Bug)
if (mainAccountFilter) {  // TRUE even for empty array []
  if (r.toAccount === mainAccountFilter) {  // String === Array → always false
    return acc + Number(r.amount || 0);
  }
}
```

### The Fix
```javascript
// ✅ AFTER (Fixed)
if (mainAccountFilter && mainAccountFilter.length > 0) {  // Check array has values
  if (mainAccountFilter.includes(r.toAccount)) {  // Use .includes() method
    return acc + Number(r.amount || 0);
  }
}
```

### Test Validation
The test suite specifically validates:
1. ✅ Totals calculate when `mainAccountFilter = []` (empty array)
2. ✅ Totals calculate when `mainAccountFilter = ['Cash']` (with values)
3. ✅ Totals update dynamically when filters change

```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests fail with "Cannot find module"
**Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
npm install
```

### Issue: "ReferenceError: document is not defined"
**Solution**: Check that `vitest.config.js` has `environment: 'jsdom'`

### Issue: CSS import errors
**Solution**: Vitest config already handles CSS with `css: true`

### Issue: Mock errors for axios or auth
**Solution**: Mocks are already configured in the test file. Ensure your actual modules export correctly.

## 📈 Coverage Report

After running `npm run test:coverage`, you'll see a detailed report:

```
File                      | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines
--------------------------|---------|----------|---------|--------
FinancialReports.jsx      |   85.23 |    78.45 |   91.67 |   84.12
```

Coverage HTML report will be generated in `coverage/index.html`

## ✅ Best Practices Implemented

1. **Mocking External Dependencies**: Axios, Auth, Modals
2. **Testing User Interactions**: Clicks, Form inputs, Navigation
3. **Async Testing**: waitFor() for API calls and state updates
4. **Isolated Tests**: Each test is independent
5. **Descriptive Test Names**: Clear intention of what's being tested
6. **Edge Cases**: Empty arrays, null values, large datasets

---

## 🎓 How to Add More Tests

### Example: Testing a New Filter

```javascript
it('should filter by sub header', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<FinancialReports />);
  
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(axios.get).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });

  const subHeaderFilter = container.querySelector('select[name="subHeaderFilter"]');
  fireEvent.change(subHeaderFilter, { target: { value: 'Sales' } });

  await waitFor(() => {
    // Verify filtered results
    const rows = screen.getAllByRole('row');
    // Add your assertions
  });
});
```

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the test output for specific error messages
2. Review the component code to ensure functionality exists
3. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Check that mock data matches your actual API response structure
